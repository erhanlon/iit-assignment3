          <h2>Evan</h2>
          <p>During this assignment, much like the previous one, our group worked together very effectively.
            Our collective abilities covered most of the required aspects of the assignment, which meant that mostly everything got done.
            Unfortunately there was initially a great deal of confusion and uncertainty when attempting to delegate tasks, which led to a long delay in beginning the project.
            Despite this, the group eventually got itself going, and things from that point progressed relatively smoothly with little need for constant checking in.
            A minor snag was hit towards the due date of the assignment when committing files to GitHub became an issue for one of our members - this was circumvented by having them send the file directly to another member and having <i>that</i> member perform the commmit.</p>
            <p>Our group's continued use of GitHub as a means of collating and combining constantly updated files led to increased efficiency among group members, as it became easy for members to view and change the work of other members without any lengthy file sending process.</p>
          <h2>Anthony</h2>
          <p>Similar to the previous assignment, our group’s ability to work as a team has once again been displayed. 
              The collective effort of all the group members was something that has made working within this group an enjoyable and memorable experience. 
              Something that could have been improved upon was yet again the ability to coordinate meetings effectively. 
              Due to the current circumstances in Victoria and everybody’s different schedules, scheduling a time has proven to be difficult yet again and could be improved upon. 
              One thing that stood out however was how well the group’s abilities were able to intertwine with one another in the sense that while some of us lacked skills in HTML, 
              others were able to step up to the task with their knowledge and expertise within that field which allowed the group to work with their strengths and as a result, 
              tasks were delegated accordingly. GitHub, although being a challenging platform to work on, 
              was rewarding in that we were able to see what each member was contributing to the assignment and allowed us to individually push our changes as required. </p>
          <h2>Matthew</h2>
          <p>I think as a group we again worked together really well. 
              This time around our communication was really good at the start of the assignment as we discussed how we were going to approach completing the assignment. 
              However, near the end of the assignment a loss of communication may have led some members to feel confused or worried on how much we had completed as a group to finish the assignment. 
              As a whole our group yet again we has a wide variety of skills to complete the assignment effectively having the research and website completed. 
              I also think that our skills with Github improved with us being able to commit, push and pull content much more easier than the previous the assignment. </p>
          <h2>Mehmet</h2>
          <p> Once again our group worked quite well during this assignment. The communication was great and everyone knew what they were doing. 
              However, delegating the work was quite confusing as we didn't know how to properly delegate this assignment. 
              The meetings were toned down this time as our schedules once again differed greatly and we couldn't find a slot where everyone was present, however, this barely effected our work. 
              Another hassle in this assignment personally was the use of GitHub. 
              After completing the work, the committing wasn't working properly for some reason. 
              Other than that, this was relatively another smooth group assignment.</p>
