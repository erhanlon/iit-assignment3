          <p>Similarly, to the previous assignment, our group’s ability to work as a team has once again been displayed. 
              The collective effort of all the group members was something that has made working within this group an enjoyable and memorable experience. 
              Something that could have been improved upon was yet again the ability to coordinate meetings effectively. 
              Due to the current circumstances in Victoria and everybody’s different schedules, scheduling a time has proven to be difficult yet again and could be improved upon. 
              One thing that stood out however was how well the group’s abilities were able to intertwine with one another in the sense that while some of us lacked skills in HTML, 
              others were able to step up to the task with their knowledge and expertise within that field which allowed the group to work with their strengths and as a result, 
              tasks were delegated accordingly. GitHub, although being a challenging platform to work on, 
              was rewarding in that we were able to see what each member was contributing to the assignment and allowed us to individually push our changes as required. </p>
          <h2>Matthew</h2>
          <p>I think as a group we again worked together really well. This time around our communication was really good at the start of the assignment as we discussed how we were going to approach completing the assignment. However, near the end of the assignment a loss of communication may have led some members to feel confused or worried on how much we had completed as a group to finish the assignment. As a whole our group yet again we has a wide variety of skills to complete the assignment effectively having the research and website completed. I also think that our skills with Github improved with us being able to commit, push and pull content much more easier than the previous the assignment. </p>
