<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h2>Aim:</h2>
<p>Our aim for this project idea is to reduce the amount of paper that is being used in the Italian restaurant, so that transactions and orders can be performed more efficiently with correct stations at the restarant getting the appropiate orders.
  For example drinks being sent towards the bar and the paying station instead of going to the kitchen. 
  Smaller goals include reducing the flow of 'dummy' items that come to stations that don't require that information to be sent or displayed in that station. 
  Having devices linked together correctly in a LAN would allow information that is received from the customer to be sent to the correct station, eliminating any possible errors that could be made by employees.  </p>	
	<h2>Current system status:</h2>
<p>Evan, one of our group members, works at an Italian restaurant, and his job is to make all the drinks for dine-in, and all desserts for both dine-in and takeaway. There is a printer in front of him that prints people's drink orders when the waitresses have put them through, and that alone isn't a problem; it works perfectly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the printer prints <i>all</i> orders that contain a drink or a dessert, whether it's relevant to his station or not - which means that whenever the printer prints a takeaway order for a bottle of Coke for example, he just takes the docket, sticks it straight onto the spike, and goes back to whatever he was doing. Another problem is that the bar printer also prints dockets containing any 'dummy' items used for price adjustment for UberEats orders, which come to him as nonsense orders (There might be an order of "U" for $0.90, for example).</p>
<h2>Scope and limits:</h2>
<p>We do not have access to the restaurant's actual system, so none of this can actually be put into practice or tested properly, which severely limits our abilities for this task to mostly guessing or prospecting. Because of this, our efforts in actually implementing the system are limited to just producing a fleshed-out idea for how the system could work in an ideal world.
  Regardless, if this were done it would certainly make Evan's life easier as the printer wouldn't print things he didn't have to worry about, and presumably other restaurants under the same franchise use a similar or identical system, and their systems could be improved too. Depending on how widespread the system is, it could even be used to improve efficiency in other restaurants as well.</p>

</p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies:</h2>
  <h4>Software</h4>
  <p>The Impos point of sale software will be used to track the sales and keep track of all the orders that come throught the restaurant. 
    This will require a license under Impos so we are able to use their software to manage the sales.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, we could build a program from scratch. In that case, the programs required to develop the system are Visual Studio Code to write the code for the system, the Python programming language for the back end, and a
    MySQL database to store the data. For the front end, HTML will be used to display the input and output elements.
    To make the data flow diagrams and entity relation diagrams to document the work for future reference, LucidChart will be used. For the group work and combining the work,
    GitHub will be used.
</p>
  <h4>Hardware</h4>
  <p>1 GB or higher RAM for the server, which will be Apache 2.4.23.
    NFC technology will be used to enable contactless payment. Monitors will be needed to display the output on the screen, which
    will have tactile input for the user commands.</p>
    <p>The restaurant could introduce company phones that have the impos software installed in them, which are able to take orders and be updated to the software immediateley so that once an order is made the system knows to send the data to the appropriate station.
  No further hardware is required.</p>
  <h2>Testing:</h2>
<p>We don't know who designed the system that decides which items go to which printer but whenever Evan has to spike an order that he doesn't have to do anything with, he dies a little inside, both at the waste of paper and at the inefficiency of whatever database system decides which items get printed where, and he always wants to fix it. To do that, he would have to do the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Investigate how the system determines what goes where - it's important to note that the bar printer is the only printer that needs changing, as the pizza and kitchen printers need to receive every order for their category regardless.</li>
    <li>Maybe create some algorithm that uses the combination of the type of item (food, drink, pizza, dessert, etc) and also the eating mode (dine-in, takeaway, UberEats), and prints accordingly - the bar printer should receive only dine-in drink orders, and all dessert orders regardless of eating mode.</li>
    <li>Perhaps add an extra category called "dummy order" for the dummy price adjustment items that doesn't get printed anywhere.</li>
    <li>Change and test the system by putting through dummy test orders for:<ul>
      <li>Every item individually, in both dine-in and takeaway/UE forms</li>
      <li>Random combinations of items, again in both eat in and eat out modes</li>
      <li>Dummy price adjusters in some orders, distributed randomly</li>
      <li>Orders that have had changes made - something added, excluded, or substituted from an order, for all food types (pizza, kitchen food, drinks)</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>Fix any errors if something gets printed to the wrong place or not at all.</li>
  </ol></p>
<!--Ideal sorting algorithm:
   For every item:
if (food)
  print kitchen printer
else if (pizza)
  print pizza printer
else if (dessert)
  print bar printer
else if (drink && category = "dine in")
  print bar printer
else if (drink && category = "takeaway")
  print front printer
else if (dummy item)
  don't print
else
  print front printer (this is mostly for debugging, as everything should have already been printed so if something prints here it hasn't been sorted properly)-->
