in an ideal, perfect world, the system would
-take and display orders
-link devices together
-track time since order creation
-potential to print if needed (eg if a screen breaks)
-send orders to where they need to be
-individually itemise orders to track which items have been delivered

aim of the system:
-remove paper from the restaurant setting entirely
-maximise efficiency of order taking and delivery using electronics
