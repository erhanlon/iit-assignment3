    <h1>Industry Research</h1>
    <p>This page contains a rough record of the research of the history of Point Of Sale systems.</p>
    <h2>Innovations</h2>
    <p>The Point of Sale system, abbreviated POS is utilized by millions of people throughout the world every day. 
      Many businesses generally make use of Point of Sales systems to assist with the purchases of goods and services. 
      The POS is different for every business, as it is individually tailored to each individual business and their different requirements and in a way is an innovation in and of itself. 
      The majority of businesses using POS have in a way innovated the system or changed how their particular POS works compared to a POS of another business. 
      This is because each business has their own particular requirements and they all operate differently, resulting in different Point of Sale systems. 
      Some of the more technical innovations comes with the introduction of cardless transactions and mobile payments. 
      This digital innovation has paved the way for many businesses as the ever-growing technological age advances further. 
      With cash slowly being pushed out of business, it’s no wonder that businesses have developed their POS systems to support cashless payments and the ability to pay with your mobile phone. 
      The push for a digital age has been welcomed by businesses adopting the POS system as it rids the need of price tags. 
      Prices can now be updated through the POS system itself and removes the need for replacing old price tags with new ones whenever a price change was needed. 
      With the introduction of cloud-computing, that is, the ability to store, manage and process data over the internet, POS systems have adopted the ability to store their data in a remote server rather than locally. 
      As a result, local hardware is not required due to the server being stored within the ‘cloud’. 
      Additionally, cloud-based point of sale systems generally have a centralized data storage which gives the business the ability to access this information from anywhere given there is an internet connection. 
      The evolution and innovative ways that businesses have adapted to implement these point of sale systems has helped tremendously in many different fields and has modernised the ways of in store purchases. </p>
